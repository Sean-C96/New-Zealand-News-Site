# NZNewsSite
 Techtorium Level 6 SRM

 I am creating a website for a company called ‘NZ News Daily’ based on current news around New Zealand and the world. They tasked me with making a website that reports on current events without intrusive ads or paywalls. There will be a home page detailing significant happenings around the world, with tabs to a NZ news section with news just about New Zealand, a sports section to show sports news and a technology page to show any current updates on significant upcoming technology.

This website will be developed using ASP.net core and MVC framework using Visual Studio 2022 IDE.
